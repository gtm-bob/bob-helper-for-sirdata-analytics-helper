# Bob's Helper for Sirdata Analytics Helper

All events played before Sirdata Analytics Helper's cookieless UUID is ready event will be played again once it is. All events pushed in dataLayer after this UUID is ready will continue to trigger your tags.
 
Use this template if you use Sirdata Analytics Helper with cookieless mode ON, and :
- you need to be able to fire a given tag several times
- you need to preserve the evenModel structure (which doesn't work with group of triggers)
